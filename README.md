# WebSpeech-on-Maps

The prototype was implemented using open source web technologies: [Mapbox] (https://www.mapbox.com/) for the base map, the [W3C location API] (https://bit.ly/3ce4Mmx) to access user location, the [Web speech API] (https://mzl.la/2UaRTDV) to incorporate voice commands into the app, and the [Web Share API] (https://bit.ly/3gKqnXx) for link sharing.
