# WebSpeech-on-Maps

The prototype was implemented using open source web technologies: [Mapbox](http://mapbox.com) for the base map, the [W3C Geolocation API](https://bit.ly/3ce4Mmx) to access user location, the [Web Speech API](https://mzl.la/2UaRTDV) to incorporate voice commands into the app, and the [Web Share API](https://bit.ly/3gKqnXx) for link sharing.
